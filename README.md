# Derivation of Machine Learning Algorithms in Python
This is a portfolio to document my derivations of common Machine Learning algoriths in python using only the numpy library, and is based on Machine Learning from Scratch online course. 
* Machine Learning Algorithms: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, K Means Clustering, Principal Component Analysis, Perceptron
* Programming Languages: Python
* Library: Numpy

## [General Application of Machine Learning Algorithms](https://github.com/mbyoung99/ML_General_Applications/blob/main/README.md)
* Projects on the application of common classification and regression machine learning algorithms and libraries in python.
* Algorithms included: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, K Means Clustering, Principal Component Analysis, Perceptron
* Analyses are performed with libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn and SciKit-Learn
